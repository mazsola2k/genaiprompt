**Installing Nginx with Podman using Ansible**
====================================================

Below is an example Ansible playbook snippet that installs an Nginx container using Podman and exposes port 443.

```yml
---
- name: Install and run Nginx container with Podman
  hosts: [localhost]
  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Install Podman and Nginx image
    dnf:
      name:
        - podman
        - nginx
      state: present

  - name: Pull Nginx image
    podman_image:
      name: nginx
      state: present

  - name: Run Nginx container
    podman_container:
      name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "443:443"
      state: started
      restart: yes
```

However, for a more idempotent and robust solution, consider using a block to ensure the container is properly configured and running:

```yml
---
- name: Install and run Nginx container with Podman
  hosts: [localhost]
  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Install Podman
    dnf:
      name: podman
      state: present

  - name: Pull Nginx image
    podman_image:
      name: nginx
      state: present

  - name: Run Nginx container
    podman_container:
      name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      published_ports:
        - "443:443"
      restart_policy: always
      state: started
```

**Variables and Customization**
-----------------------------

You can customize the playbook by adding variables for the image name, container name, and ports.

```yml
---
- name: Install and run Nginx container with Podman
  hosts: [localhost]
  become: yes
  vars:
    container_name: nginx-container
    image_name: nginx
    host_port: 443
    container_port: 443

  tasks:
  - name: Install Podman
    dnf:
      name: podman
      state: present

  - name: Pull Nginx image
    podman_image:
      name: "{{ image_name }}"
      state: present

  - name: Run Nginx container
    podman_container:
      name: "{{ container_name }}"
      image: "{{ image_name }}"
      published_ports:
        - "{{ host_port }}:{{ container_port }}"
      restart_policy: always
      state: started
```

**Example Usage**
-----------------

Save the playbook to a file (e.g., `nginx-podman.yml`) and run it using the command:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx-podman.yml
```
